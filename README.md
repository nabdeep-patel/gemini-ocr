## Project Overview

📝 **Description:** In this project, I've developed an Image QA_Bot using Google's GenerativeAI API. The bot can generate responses to questions based on an input image. Users can capture an image from their webcam or upload an image. Then, they can input a prompt/question, and the bot will generate a response based on the image and the prompt.

## Model Architecture

🔍 **Generative Model:** Google's GenerativeAI API powers the bot to understand and generate responses based on the provided input image and prompt. The model architecture is proprietary and optimized for image-related question answering tasks.
